The role social media platforms play on the emergence of polarisation is an ongoing debate in the political communication literature. Social media’s filter bubbles and online echo chambers shape people’s opinions by curating the information they have available. However, the extent to which this is the case remains unclear. Social simulation scholars have provided valuable insights into the subject through opinion dynamics models and agent-based modelling approaches. This article proposes a social simulation approach to the topic of opinion dynamics from a political communication perspective to understand how social network configurations and the media environment contribute to the emergence of national identity polarisation. We built an agent-based simulation model of national identity dynamics with a multilayer multiplex network of interacting agents in a hybrid media environment of both, traditional media and social media platforms. We use the Catalan secessionist movement to ground, contextualise and empirically inform parts of our model. We found that the initial social network setup conditions had a large impact on the emergence of polarisation amongst agents. In particular, homophily-based social networks composed of a majority of like-minded individuals produced greater polarisation compared to random networks. This was aggravated in the presence of social media filtering algorithms, selectively exposing agents to supportive information. These results emphasise the importance of both the selective exposure by social media filtering algorithms and one’s social networks (echo chambers) for polarisation to emerge. This interaction reinforces the influence of social media platforms and social networks have on the emergence of polarisation.
