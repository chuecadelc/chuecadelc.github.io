Since I joined my first Social Simulation Conference in Milan (Sept 2022), I became actively involved in the community and wanted to give back by running for the management committee. In September 2024, I accomplished that when I run and got elected with enthusiasm and a committment to fostering a stronger community and promoting the interests of early career researchs, like myself, and PhD and Masters students. 

In this role, I have been actively participating on the monthly management meetings composed of eleven senior academics acros European research institutes and universities that have a longstanding membership to this community and committee. I have taken responsibilities on the communications and events workstreams coordinating with other members the organisation of events as well as our communication stragegy (social media and members newsletter) and website design (WordPress). 

I have also been the lead organiser of the Social Simulation Fest [SocSimFest](https://socsimfest.eu/) in both, the 2025 edition and the upcoming 2026 edition, supported by other MC colleagues too. This two-day online event brings current and interested academics in the social simulation. There are multiple hands-on workshops and interactive discussions besides two one-hour inspirational speakers (equivalent to keynotes in a conference setting) sessions who share their research and answer questions. 

I look forward to continuing on my role following the upcoming election at the Social Simulation Conference in Durham (UK, August 2026) where I hope to be re-elected.
