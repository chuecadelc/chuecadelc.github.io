While I was doing my PhD in Politics at Glasgow University which involved social network modelling I applied to become a committee member of the Social Network Analysis in Scotland (SNAS) Group and got accepted by the management committee. The primary reasons for joining were eagerness to bring a PhD student perspective into this group of established interdisciplinary scholars in network science in addition to wanting to take on responsibility in the organisation and delivery of research activities.

Since March 2021, I have been advocating for PhD students and building a stronger community through various in person and virtual training and social events. One of the most popular events I have led the organisation and delivery of has been the PostGraduate Researcher (PGR) Roundtable which has been running for four years now. This one-day event brings together current PhD students based at a Scottish University, with various levels of expertise in social network analysis and that are using this method in their research (all disciplines), to present their work among their peers and receive questions/support from the SNAS Committee. This event often bring between 10 and 15 PhD candidates, some of which have previously participated. Other events I have organised have been the upcoming PGR Introduction to SNA workshop, applied to Arts and Humanities PhD candidates (University of Stirling, March 2026). On March 2022, I organised and supported in the delivery of the (virtual) Introduction to Social Network Analysis workshop. This two half-day virtual event was led by Dr. Eva Fernandez (Geneva University) and Dr Lukas Lethosky (Masary University) and had twelve PhD students attending. 

Moreover, I have been jointly coordinating the annual seminar series (September to June) by inviting guest speakers (local and international) as well as helping with the communications. I managed our Twitter account since 2021 when I created it until 2024 when we decided to focus mainly on our newsletter. One of the issues I pushed for and was successful in was to allocate one slot to Scotland-based PhD students who were close to submission so they could showcase their work to our regular audience and get experience presenting their research. 

I have continued to serve in this committee despite of no longer being based at a Scottish University as I moved to Durham University. I intend to continue being part of this amazing group and contributing to SNAS as my career path evolves.
