I re-implemented four classical network generators in Julia. These were:

* Erdos-Renyi, Erdős, P, and A Rényi. 1960. On the evolution of random graphs. Publications of the Institute of Mathematics, Hungarian Academy of Science 5:17–60.
* Watts-Strogatz, Watts, DJ, and SH Strogatz. 1998. Collective dynamics of ’small-world’ networks. Nature 393:440–442.
* Barabasi-Albert,Barabási, AL, and R Albert. 1999. Emergence of scaling in random networks. Science 286 (5439): 509–512.
* Molloy-Reed (commonly known as Configuration model), Molloy, M, and B Reed. 1995. A critical point for random graphs with a given degree sequence. Random Structures and Algorithms 6:161–179.
